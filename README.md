### RecipeBoss

_This is an example app for the purposes of evaluating a candidate's coding ability._

RecipeBoss is a Recipe Management system that allows users to create and store their favorite recipes and easily look them up. The app has a few bugs and a few incomplete features, and your job is to get it all in proper working order.

To complete the task, _clone_ (not fork) the repository, do your work as you normally would, and create a new repository in your Github account. Send the link to the repo when you're done.

Don't worry about real persistence, this is all client side stuff. Use your best judgement, use whatever tools or NPM packages you need, and implement things in the way that makes the most sense to you.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! Keep it simple, I don't expect this to take up an unreasonable amount of time!

## Bugs to Fix

~ 1. Images on the recipe cards don't all seem to work as expected. Some cards have them, some don't! ~
~ 2. Some recipe cards seem to cut off the recipe text. ~
~ 3. Recipe cards should be in an evenly-distributed grid below the nav, but they sit on top of the nav in a single column! ~

## Features

1. Add a way for a user to create new recipes and add them to the list.
2. Add a way for a user to delete a recipe they no longer want to track.
3. Using your favorite image api, give the user the ability to search for an image for their recipe. Don't have a favorite? Check out Unsplash, Pixabay, Bing, Giphy, or good ol' Google.

## Bonus

1. Think of another cool feature to add? Want to play with the design? Feel free to play and show off! No pressure though!
